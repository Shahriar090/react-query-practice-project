## Introduction

React Query is a powerful library for managing server-state in React applications. It simplifies data fetching, caching, synchronization, and more, making it easier to manage remote data in your application.

## Features

- **Data fetching and caching**: Efficiently retrieves and caches server data.
- **Automatic background data synchronization**: Keeps data fresh by updating it in the background.
- **Query invalidation and refetching**: Ensures outdated data is refetched automatically.
- **Pagination and infinite scrolling**: Handles large datasets with ease.
- **Optimistic updates**: Provides an instant UI update while confirming server changes.
